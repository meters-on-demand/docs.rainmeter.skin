# Getting started

Meters on Demand or `mond` is a package manager for Rainmeter skins.

## Installation

Meters on Demand uses a Rainmeter skin as the installer so it can get information about your Rainmeter installation.

1. Download and install the latest .rmskin from [releases](https://github.com/meters-on-demand/cli/releases) on GitHub.
2. Open any [terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701) (cmd, powershell, git bash) and run `mond version` to confirm it's installed properly.

## Just in case

You might be looking for the Mond skin. If that's the case, get [Mondtholomew](https://reisir.github.io/mondtholomew), a fixed version of the skin.
