# Need help? 

Join the [Rainmeter Discord](https://discord.gg/rainmeter) and tag [@reisir](https://github.com/reisir) in the [#help](https://discord.com/channels/148103787259756544/148718731743199233) channel. Do not fucking DM me thank you :3

You may also [email me](mailto:reisirito@gmail.com) but discord will reach me (and a lot of other knowledgeable people) much faster than email.

You can also open an [issue](https://github.com/meters-on-demand/mond-api/issues) on GitHub but I would prefer those to be reserved for bug reports, feature requests and the like.
